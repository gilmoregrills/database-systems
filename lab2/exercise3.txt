 
Exercise 3: dates
 
1) Select the name, job and hiredate of the employees in dept 20 
(format the hiredate column using a picture of mm/dd/yy)
 
SELECT ename, job, CONVERT(VARCHAR(8), hiredate, 1) FROM emp WHERE deptno='20'; - doesn't, looks like SQL server syntax! 
SELECT ename, job, to_char(hiredate, 'MM-DD-YY') FROM emp WHERE deptno='20'; - works

2) Use a picture to format hiredate as: day (day of the week), 
month (name of the month), dd (day of the month) and yyyy (year). 
e.g. wednesday, january, 12, 1983

SELECT ename, job, to_char(hiredate, 'Day, Month, DD, YYYY') FROM emp WHERE deptno='20';
	//capitalised Day and Month, it works!

3) Use the format mask suffix 'th' in a picture (oracle will put 
a suffix after the field (ddth).)

SELECT ename, job, to_char(hiredate, 'DDTH, Month, YYYY') FROM emp WHERE deptno='20';
 
4) Select the name and hiredate of department 20's employees in 
the following format:
 
SELECT ename, to_char(hiredate, 'Month DDTH, YYYY, HH12:MM AM') FROM emp WHERE deptno='20';

ename, hiredate
adams, january 12th, 1983, 11:05 am
