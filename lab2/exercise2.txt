 
exercise 2: functions
 
1) Find out how many managers there are without listing them. 

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emp WHERE job='MANAGER';

3.
 
2) Compute the average annual salary + commission for all 
salesman

SELECT AVG((sal+comm)*12) FROM emp WHERE job='SALESMAN';

avg(sal+comm)*12 23,400
 
3) Find the highest and lowest paid employees and the difference 
between them

SELECT MAX(sal), MIN(sal), MAX(sal)-MIN(sal) FROM emp;

max(sal) 5,000
min(sal) 800
max(sal)-min(sal) 4200
 
4) Find the number of characters in the longest department name

SELECT MAX(LENGTH(dname)) from DEPT;

max(length(dname)) 10
 
5) Count the number of people in department 30 who receive 
a salary and the number of people who receive a commission

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emp 
	WHERE deptno='30' AND comm>'0';
SELECT COUNT(*S) FROM emp
	WHERE deptno='30' AND sal>'0';

count(sal) 6
count(comm) 4
 
6) List the average commission of employees who receive a 
commission and the average commission of all employees (treating 
employees who do not receive a commission as receiving a zero 
commission)

SELECT AVG(comm) FROM emp WHERE comm>'0';
SELECT AVG(comm) FROM emp;
avg(comm) 550
avg(nvl(comm,0)) 157.142857
 
7) List the average salary of employees that receive a salary, 
the average commission of employees that receive a commission, 
the average salary plus commission of only those employees that 
receive a commission and average salary plus commission of all 
employees including those who do not receive a commission

SELECT AVG(sal) FROM emp WHERE sal>'0';
SELECT AVG(comm) FROM emp WHERE comm>'0';
SELECT AVG(sal+comm) FROM emp WHERE comm>'0';
SELECT AVG(comm) FROM emp;

avg(sal) 2,073.21
avg(comm) 550.00
avg(sal+comm) 1,950.00
avg(sal+nvl(comm,0)) 1,933.23
 
8) Compute the daily and hourly salaries for emplyees 
in department 30. Round the results to the nearest penny. Assume 
there are 22 working days in a month and 8 working hours in a day.

SELECT ename, ROUND(sal/22, 2) FROM emp WHERE deptno='30';
SELECT ename, ROUND(sal/22/8, 2) FROM emp WHERE deptno='30';

 
9) Issue the same query as the previous one except that this time 
truncate (trunc) to the nearest penny rather than round.

SELECT ename, TRUNC(sal/22, 2) FROM emp WHERE deptno='30';
SELECT ename, TRUNC(sal/22/8, 2) FROM emp WHERE deptno='30';
