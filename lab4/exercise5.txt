
Exercise 5: group by
 
/1) List the department number and average salary of each 
department

I was overthinking it

SELECT deptno, AVG(sal) 
FROM emp
GROUP BY deptno;

/2) Divide all employees into groups by department and by 
job within department. Count the employees in each group 
and compute each groups average annual salary

SELECT deptno, job, AVG(sal)
FROM emp
GROUP BY deptno, job;

bonus: ORDER BY job - makes it interesting
 
/3) Issue the same query as above except list the department name 
rather than the department number
 
SELECT D.dname, job, AVG(sal)
FROM dept D, emp E
GROUP BY D.dname, E.job;

/4) List the average annual salary for all job groups having more 
than 2 employees in the group

SELECT AVG(sal*12), job,
FROM emp
GROUP BY job
HAVING COUNT(job) > 2;

5) List all the departments that have at least two clerks

SELECT D.dname, D.deptno
FROM dept D, emp E
HAVING E.job='clerk';
 
SELECT D.dname, E.deptno, COUNT(SELECT * FROM E.deptno WHERE E.job='CLERK') AS clerks
FROM dept D, emp E
HAVING clerks > 2;

6) Find all departments with an average commission greaterthan 
25% of average salary

SELECT D.dname, E.deptno
FROM dept D, emp E
HAVING AVG(comm) > AVG(sal)/4;
 
SELECT D.dname, E.deptno, AVG(E.comm) AS avgcomm, AVG(E.sal) AS avgsal
FROM dept D, emp E
HAVING avgcomm > avgsal;


7) Find each departments average annual salary for all its 
employees except the manager's and the president's



/8) List the average annual salary for all job groups having more 
than two employees in a group

IDENTICAL TO #4?

SELECT AVG(sal*12), job,
FROM emp
GROUP BY job
HAVING COUNT(job) > 2;
