
Exercise 1: joines
 
1) Find the name and salary of employees in dallas

SELECT ename, sal
	FROM emp E, dept D
	WHERE D.loc='DALLAS';
 
2) Join the dept table to the emp table and show in department 
number order

SELECT *
	FROM emp E, dept D
	ORDER BY D.deptno;
 
3) List all departments that have employees plus those 
departments that do not have employees

SELECT dname
	FROM emp E, dept D
	WHERE E.deptno=D.deptno; - this is wrong but this question makes no sense??
 
4) List all departments that do not have any employees:

if what they want is a left outer join I've got

SELECT D.deptno, E.deptno, ename, dname
FROM dept D LEFT OUTER JOIN emp E
ON D.deptno = E.deptno;

and we can confirm that operations has no employees by doing 

SELECT * FROM emp WHERE deptno='40';
 
5) Find all the employees that earn more than jones 
usingtemporary labels to abreviate table names

SELECT * 
	FROM emp E
	WHERE E.sal > (SELECT e.sal
		FROM E
		WHERE E.ename='JONES');
 
6) For each employee whose salary exceeds his manager's salary 
list the employee's name and a salary and the manager's name and 
salary

CREATE GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE managers
	(ename VARCHAR2(10), sal NUMBER(7,2), empno (NUMBER(4)) ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS;

INSERT INTO managers
	SELECT ename, sal, empno
	FROM emp
	WHERE job='MANAGER';


SELECT E.ename, E.sal, M.ename, M.sal
	FROM emp E, managers M
	WHERE E.mgr=M.empno AND E.sal>M.sal;
